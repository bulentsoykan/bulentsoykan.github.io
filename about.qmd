## Bulent Soykan

I’m an academic researcher based in Florida, specializing in AI-driven simulation modeling, digital twin technologies, and mathematical optimization. My work focuses on leveraging machine learning to enhance decision-making, with a recent emphasis on reinforcement learning.

Beyond research, I enjoy building software that helps people make better decisions. I believe in simplicity—both in problem-solving and communication. My approach is always to understand and explain the "why" rather than just the "how."

This blog is a place where I share insights on AI, optimization, and digital twins, as well as thoughts on software, research methodologies, and decision-making. If you’re interested in these topics, I hope you’ll find something valuable here.
