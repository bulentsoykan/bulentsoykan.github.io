Conditional List Comprehensions\nThe walrus operator shines in list comprehensions, especially when filtering based on computed values:\n# Without walrus operator\nfiltered_results = []\nfor x in data:\n    result = complex_calculation(x)\n    if result &gt; threshold:\n        filtered_results.append(result)\n\n# With walrus operator\nfiltered_results = [result for x in data if (result := complex_calculation(x)) &gt; threshold]\nHere, we avoid calculating complex_calculation(x) twice, making the code both more efficient and more readable.\n\n\n3. Regex Matching\nRegular expression matching often benefits from the walrus operator:\n# Without walrus operator\nmatch = pattern.search(text)\nif match:\n    process(match.group(1))\n\n# With walrus operator\nif match := pattern.search(text):\n    process(match.group(1))"

This can hide problems and make debugging extremely difficult. Instead, always catch specific exceptions:\ntry:\n    do_something()\nexcept KeyError:\n    print(\"Key not found in dictionary!\")\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Invalid value encountered!\")"

    "text": "In Python, object-oriented programming (OOP) is a key approach for writing reusable and modular code. A class is like a blueprint that defines how objects, which are instances of the class, are created and behave. Python’s OOP is shaped by its dynamic typing and first-class functions, offering more flexibility compared to languages like Java or C++.\n\n\n\nPython attributes include member variables, methods, and properties. A property looks like a regular attribute from the outside but uses methods to control how it’s accessed or modified. This is great for encapsulation, letting you manage an object’s internal state safely.\nYou create properties with the @property decorator. By default, a property is read-only, but you can add a setter to make it writable.\nHere’s an example:\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._value = 0  # Protected attribute\n\n    @property\n    def value(self):\n        return self._value\n\n    @value.setter\n    def value(self, new_value):\n        if new_value &gt;= 0:\n            self._value = new_value\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Value must be non-negative\")\n\n\n\n_value is a protected attribute (the underscore is a convention).\nThe value property lets you get _value with the getter (@property).\nThe setter (@value.setter) ensures only non-negative values are allowed.\nThis setup is perfect for read-only attributes or adding validation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFactory patterns help create objects in a flexible and organized way, especially when creation logic is complex. In Python, we’ll look at two types: the Simple Factory Pattern and the Factory Method Pattern.\n\n\nThe Simple Factory Pattern uses a single function or method to create objects based on input. It’s straightforward and works when object types are fixed.\nExample:\nclass Animal:\n    def speak(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def speak(self):\n        return \"Woof!\"\n\nclass Cat(Animal):\n    def speak(self):\n        return \"Meow!\"\n\ndef animal_factory(animal_type):\n    if animal_type == \"dog\":\n        return Dog()\n    elif animal_type == \"cat\":\n        return Cat()\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unknown animal type\")\n\n\n\n\nanimal_factory takes an animal_type and returns a Dog or Cat.\nThe client only needs to call the factory, not handle creation details.\n\n\n\n\nThe Factory Method Pattern is more flexible. It defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide the specific type. This shines when object types need to vary at runtime.\nExample:\nclass Creator:\n    def factory_method(self):\n        pass\n\n    def some_operation(self):\n        product = self.factory_method()\n        return product.speak()\n\nclass DogCreator(Creator):\n    def factory_method(self):\n        return Dog()\n\nclass CatCreator(Creator):\n    def factory_method(self):\n        return Cat()\n\n\n\n\nCreator has an abstract factory_method that subclasses like DogCreator and CatCreator implement.\nsome_operation uses the factory method without knowing the exact object type.\nAdding new types is easy—just create a new subclass.\n\nPython’s OOP tools, like properties for controlling attribute access and factory patterns for flexible object creation, make it easy to write clean, scalable code. These features leverage Python’s dynamic nature, giving you powerful ways to design applications. Explore them further to master Python’s OOP!"
